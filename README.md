# Project 1: Avengers Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLTK

Objective:
To analyze the sentiment of movie reviews for the Avengers series using Natural Language Processing techniques with NLTK.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of a collection of movie reviews for various Avengers movies sourced from online platforms. 

Methodology
The sentiment analysis is performed using NLTK's built-in sentiment analyzer, which provides a pre-trained model for classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed. The main steps of the analysis include:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the text data by removing noise, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing NLTK's sentiment analyzer to classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral.

Results
The sentiment analysis using NLTK's sentiment analyzer found that the reviews was classified as positive. The sentiment analyzer assigns the review a sentiment label of positive, negative, or neutral based on the overall sentiment expressed in the text.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
NLTK library

# Project 2: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis using BERT

Description:
This project leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. BERT's contextual embeddings capture nuanced sentiment.

Data Collection:
Collect a dataset of restaurant reviews with sentiment labels (positive, negative).

Environment Setup: 
Install the required libraries, including TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library (pip install transformers).

Model Training: 
Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on the restaurant review dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

Deployment: 
Deploy the trained BERT model for real-time sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Hugging Face Transformers
